# Mobile ROBOT Project - Line Following, Color Detection and Obstacle Avoidance 

## Overview 
This project consists of two autonomous mobile robots developed using ESP32 microcontrollers. The robots can operate autonomously or be controlled remotely via a mobile application using Bluetooth.
This project integrates embedded systems, sensors, motor control and wireless communication. 

This project was developed as part of my Robotics specialization at Universitat Poliècnica de València. 

## Features 
- Autonomous line following using infrared sensors (TCRT5000)
- Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Bluetooth control via mobile app (MIT App Inventor)
- Real-time counter system using sensor detection
- Manual and autonomous operation modes

## Hardware 
- ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller
- L298N motor driver
